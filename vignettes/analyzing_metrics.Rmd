title: "Analyzing TNTP Common Metrics"
author: "Adam Maier"
description: >
  This vignette shows how to use tntpmetric to quickly calculate average scores
  on common metrics given a raw data set. These calculations can be used 
  directly for goal reporting. It uses fake student survey data as an example
  to walk through all the possible analyses: calculating a metric score at a
  single timepoint, growth over time, and differences between subgroups.
